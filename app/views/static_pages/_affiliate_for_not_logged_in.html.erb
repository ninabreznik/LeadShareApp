  </div>
  <div class="affiliate_program_offer_instructions">
    When a new user clicks your referral link, signs up for an account and purchases an item (or deposits money) via any of the Envato Market sites, you will receive 30% of that person's first cash deposit or purchase price. If they deposit $20 into their account, you get $6. If they buy a $200 item, you get $60.
    By becoming an Affiliate, you agree to the Affiliate Program Terms.
