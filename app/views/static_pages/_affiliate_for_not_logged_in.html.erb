    How the affiliate program works
  </div>
  <div class="affiliate_program_offer_promotion">
    Create a ZweiDesign Account, then send traffic to the Find & hire page while adding your tracking id to the end of the URL.
  </div>
  <div class="affiliate_program_offer_instructions">
    When a new user clicks your referral link and places an order, providers are notified. When a provider purchases the lead (or deposits money), you will receive 50% of that person's first cash deposit or purchase price. If they deposit €20 into their account, you get €10. If they buy leads worth €100, you get €50.
    By becoming an Affiliate, you agree to the Affiliate Program Terms.
